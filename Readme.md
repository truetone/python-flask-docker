# Flask app in Docker

![.github/workflows/python-package.yml](https://github.com/truetone/python-flask-docker/workflows/.github/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)

A small Flask app for my website.

I wanted to explore:

* writing tests in python again
* building a Flask Docker container
* CSS grid
* Other CSS & JS experiments
